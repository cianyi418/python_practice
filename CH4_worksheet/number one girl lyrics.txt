Tell me that I'm special
Tell me I look pretty
Tell me I'm a little angel
Sweetheart of your city
Say what I'm dying to hear
'Cause I'm dying to hear you

Tell me I'm that new thing
Tell me that I'm relevant
Tell me that I got a big heart
Then back it up with evidence
I need it and I don't know why
This late at night

Isn't it lonely?
I'd do anything to make you want me
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
Your one and only
So what's it gon' take for you to want me
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes

Tell me I'm going real big places
Down to earth, so friendly
And even through all the phases
Tell me you accept me
Well, that's all I'm dying to hear
Yeah, I'm dying to hear you

Tell me that you need me
Tell me that I'm loved
Tell me that I'm worth it
And that I'm enough
I need it and I don't know why
This late at night

Isn't it lonely?
I'd do anything to make you want me
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
Your one and only
So what's it gon' take for you to want me
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes

The girl in your eyes (eyes)
The girl in your eyes
Tell me I'm the number one girl
I'm the number one girl in your eyes
The girl in your eyes (eyes)
The girl in your eyes
Tell me I'm the number one girl
I'm the number one girl in your eyes

Well, isn't it lonely?
I'd do anything to make you want me
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
Your one and only
So what's it gon' take for you to want me
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes

The number one girl in your eyes
